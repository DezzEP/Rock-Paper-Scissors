# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A game of rock paper scissors... with buttons!

The computer will randomly select rock paper or scissors.

The player (you), can click rock paper or scissors in the web browser.

The score will be tracked and expressed to the user.

It's just rock paper scissors so I don't think it justifies more information.

Incase it does (maybe this is recovered 1000 years into the future.. )

Again if this is 1000 years into the future this link will probably not work.
