# Rock-Paper-Scissors
a no GUI game of rock paper scissors.

The computer will randomly select a number between 0-2, each number will have a value of rock paper or scissors.

It will simply be a <script> running in an html file.

There will be no actual content on the website, it will strictly be played from the console.

The user can enter r or rock, p or paper, s or scissors, or e or exit to exit the game.

The score will be tracked and expressed to the user.

It's just rock paper scissors so I don't think it justifies more info.
